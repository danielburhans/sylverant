With the closing of Google Code, Sylverant is moving to Sourceforge. The new project page is: https://sourceforge.net/projects/sylverant .

Sylverant is an open-source Phantasy Star Online server written for Unix-like Operating Systems. It is most highly tested on FreeBSD, but has also been run successfully on Mac OS X and Cygwin (note that neither of these are particularly supported by the author directly).
